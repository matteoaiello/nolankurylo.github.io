                            <br>
                            <p> Since entering the University of Victoria in the Software Engineering Co-op Program, I
                                have become accustomed to living on my own and learning to manage my finances without
                                the support of my parents. Before attending university, I had saved up some money that
                                would eventually be put towards tuition, rent, groceries and other expenses. I quickly
                                learned how easy it was to spend unnecessary amounts of money on things I probably could
                                have done without. During my first year, it became apparent to me that the cost of the
                                little things added up over time and I wasn’t going to be able to afford university if I
                                wasn’t more careful with my spending. While this was my first time living on my own and
                                financially independent, I eventually figured out how to properly manage my expenses.
                                Although I had some money to rely on that I made from before attending university, I had
                                no income being a full-time student.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Over the first two years of my degree, the money I had initially saved up began to run
                                low as I put it towards tuition, rent and other necessities. During my first two co-op
                                work terms, I was working at a small start-up company and decided to sacrifice a larger
                                pay cheque for better experience. It was a decision that I believe will be more
                                beneficial in the long run. Thus, I was only able to make enough pay for the cost of
                                living and the next semester’s tuition costs, with no carry over. This left me at a
                                break-even point before beginning the next school semester. Being back in school, I had
                                no source of income for two semesters until my next co-op work term. Inevitably, I
                                decided to take out a two term, 8-month student loan from the Canadian government.
                            </p>
                            <p>Currently, I am in the final semester of my student loan which should last me until May
                                2020. By the end of this current semester, I will be $16,000 in debt to the Canadian
                                government for student loans. With the second half of my degree remaining, I have two
                                co-op work terms left along with four school semesters. Mathematically speaking in the
                                worst case (assuming minimum wage for both jobs), I am in the same position as the first
                                half of my degree where I can only afford expenses for the duration of both co-op
                                placements plus the following semester of each. This means that for the remainder of my
                                degree, I will require another $16,000 in student loans. Upon completion of my degree, I
                                have calculated that I will owe no more than $32,000 debt in student loans to the
                                Canadian Government. </p>
                            
                            <p> While I have determined how much it will cost to complete my degree, I have also begun
                                planning how I will pay back the cost of my student loans. Recently, I have had a
                                monthly budget set up through a mobile application, “Mint”, that has allowed me to
                                incorporate my bank account and design a budget for various categories of expenditures.
                                With an already existing savings account, I have tightened my previous monthly budget in
                                order to deposit the difference left over at the end of each month. This account is
                                slowly accumulating interest and by the time I complete my degree, there will be a
                                sufficient amount of money to initiate the pay back of my student loan. Once I complete
                                my degree, a “grace period” begins where I have six months interest-free on paying back
                                my loan. To avoid accumulating interest, it is recommended that as much of this loan as
                                possible is paid back during this period. By adding small amounts of money to a savings
                                account monthly, I will be able to pay a large portion of my loan as soon as the grace
                                period begins.</p>
                            <p>
                                After the grace period ends, I will still have a segment of the student loan to pay
                                back. Throughout my degree, I have had the opportunity to obtain work experience through
                                various co-op work terms. While already completing two of the four, I plan to continue
                                to build my resume and skillset for a career in the software engineering industry. For
                                my fourth and final co-op work term, I plan to pursue a company that is known for hiring
                                / continuing to employ co-op students upon graduation. By receiving an offer to continue
                                working at a specific company after graduating, I will be able to maintain a steady
                                income. At this point, I will save in a similar sense as before. By setting aside a
                                certain amount of money every month, I can provide monthly payments to settle the
                                remainder of the loan.
